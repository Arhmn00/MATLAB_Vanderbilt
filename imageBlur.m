%{Image blur
î˜¹
Write a function called blur that blurs the input image. The function is to be called like this:
output = blur(img,w);
where img, the input image is a two-dimensional matrix of grayscale pixel values between 0 and 255. Blurring is to be carried out by averaging the pixel values in the vicinity of
every pixel. Specifically, the output pixel value is the mean of the pixels in a square submatrix of size 2w+1 where the given pixel sits in the center. For example, if w is 1, then we
use a 3x3 matrix, that is, we average all the neighboring pixels of the given pixel and itself. Only use valid pixels when portions of the blurring matrix fall outside the image. For
example, the blurred value corresponding to w = 1 at index (1,1) would be the mean of of elements (1,1), (1, 2), (2,1) and (2, 2). Both input img and output output are of type
uint8.

function out = blur(img,w)
    % convert to double for doing calculations
    imgD = double(img);
    [row, col] = size(img);
    out = zeros(row, col);
    for ii = 1:row
        for jj = 1:col
            % Get the indices for a submatrix
            r1 = ii-w;
            r2 = ii+w;
            c1 = jj-w;
            c2 = jj+w;
            % Test that indices are valid
            % If not, set to min/max that is valid
            if r1 < 1
                r1 = 1;
            end
            if r2 > row
                r2 = row;
            end
            if c1 < 1
                c1 = 1;
            end
            if c2 > col
                c2 = col;
            end
            % Get the submatrix and assign the mean to the output pixel
            m = imgD(r1:r2, c1:c2);
            out(ii,jj) = mean(m(:));
        end
    end
    % convert back to uint8
    out = uint8(out);
